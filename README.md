# guessing-game

Generates a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9).
Asks the user to guess the number,
then tells them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.

Keeps the game going until the user types “exit”.
Keeps track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, prints this out.
